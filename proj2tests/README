I tried to make my test files as easy to run as possible,
while also making them useful to you, the grader. To do
this, I made them executable shell script files. These need to 
be run as root, and don't need to be compiled to be ran.
All you have to do is run ./port_test.sh or ./file_test.sh
in this directory, and it should run everything by itself.
It also runs make in proj2driver, if you don't feel like doing that yourself,
since they use the driver files written there to make the system calls.
(I'm not lazy, I'm resourceful.)

port_test.sh tests port blocking. It first tries to ping google.com,
to see if port 80 is accessible, then blocks port 80 from being bound to.
It then tries to ping google again, which should fail. It prints the access
count of port 80, then unblocks it to finish that off. It 
then does the same stuff with UDP packets being sent to localhost.
I'd like to say that the print messages are pretty self-explanitory.

file_test.sh first HEAD's the first line of this file, then blocks it
using the driver file in proj2driver. It then tries to HEAD this file again,
but that should fail since the file's blocked. After that, it prints the access 
count of this file and unblocks it.
